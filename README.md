# Unifi::Client
Fake pull request for test data.
I wanted to:

- Watch for my phone connecting to my wifi
- Disable recording while I'm at home.
- Enable recording when I leave.

This client doest that and only that for v5 of Unifi Api and V2 of Unifi Video API as of 1-8-2018.

There's bad code here.
